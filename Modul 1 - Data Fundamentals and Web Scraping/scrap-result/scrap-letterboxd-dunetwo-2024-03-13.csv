cassiasimone8,12 Mar 2024,CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sahil,12 Mar 2024,Dune: Part Two is techinal film-making at its finest. 
Mace,13 Mar 2024,"I‚Äôm obsessed. I love this one more than first. The cinematography is breathtaking. The soundtrack is perfect. The actors are incredibly talented. The production is unreal. Everything about it is beautiful. I‚Äôm in love. The ending was abrupt, but hopefully there will be a third, otherwise I might start a riot."
Micha Jetter,13 Mar 2024,"Ton im Kino war eindeutig zu laut, aber als man die Vibrationen der Ornithopter im Sessel gesp√ºhrt hat, wars schon kurz ganz geil."
Emm,13 Mar 2024,Vista 09/03

calebsycamore99,01 Mar 2024,I found out after watching this I might be the Lisan al Gaib (I also dream of Zendaya and Anya-Taylor Joy)
Maxence Barneix,13 Mar 2024,LISAN AL-GAIB !
Robin Whalley,11 Mar 2024,God only knows how much fun Javier Bardem had making this.
Vibhor Sharma,13 Mar 2024,"Epic is what comes to mind after watching this. Just amazing, Denis Villeneuve is the best when it comes to directing films that are unconventional. What a blast!"

Jacksontackett,12 Mar 2024,"Rumor has it Feyd-Rautha is still immersed in his role as Elvis, what a bald little inspiration!"
Holly Hazelwood,11 Mar 2024,Christ! That was fucking EPIC!!
JabbaK,13 Mar 2024,Dennis does it again. Timothee and Butler were exceptionally good
Travis Jack Holmes,13 Mar 2024,One hell of a movie...

Enta,13 Mar 2024,Lady jessica's sooo me!!! (i believe i have prophetic dreams and i lie)
mirr,13 Mar 2024,Such a pleasant theater experience
abybaby,13 Mar 2024,Having read the book (basically water of life) I can see now that the path to paradise was so very narrow and Villeneuve has threaded the needle. Most things are improved from the books and I'm guessing the omitted parts will play a big role in the next movie cause they don't have a big part in this story yet.
Germano Gon√ßalves,12 Mar 2024,#8
jackdeichert,10 Mar 2024,Haven‚Äôt had this much in a theater in such a long time. There were moments where I was giddy with excitement. See it on the biggest screen you can. It should also be mentioned that this picture was made for a fraction of what a Marvel movie is made for and blew them all out of the water quality-wise.¬†
Ephraim Stites,13 Mar 2024,Watching space guerrilla warfare on the big screen fulfills a carnal male desire. Despite this Dune 2 felt rushed as many details of the work are lost in translation from novel to film. Still the back bone of the film is found in the stunning visuals and on screen effects. I don‚Äôt understand why Elvis and Rue from Euphoria are in this though.
Thommy98,13 Mar 2024,"This was a fun watch. The movie is quite a long one. But time flew by anyway. Visually it is amazing. The story is a bit more complex to follow sometimes. And you really shouldn't drift off for a moment, otherwise you potentially will miss a important part of information of the movie. But it is the first movie this year (2024) that i have rated with five stars. "
Silvia C,12 Mar 2024,"Molto bello.Forse poteva tipo metterci un po' MENO trama qua dentro, che sono cinque storie in uno? Espert…ô di Dune non mi odiate."
Tom Merison,13 Mar 2024,"This planet must have an itchy anus, cause it‚Äôs GOT WORMS!¬†"
danielbower,13 Mar 2024,"""Don't be shocked by the tone of my voiceCheck out my new weapon, weapon of choice"""
The Smash Hit Chronicles,12 Mar 2024,"Dune Part Two is a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking. With its stunning visuals and stellar performances, it cements Denis Villeneuve's status as one of the premier directors of his generation. Fans of the Dune saga will undoubtedly be thrilled by this faithful adaptation, while newcomers will be drawn in by its epic scale! This film is nothing short of a cinematic triumph and earns a well-deserved appreciation throughout."
Haleigh,12 Mar 2024,Whenever something inconvenient or dramatic happens in my life I‚Äôm just gonna go ‚Äúaaaayaaaayaaa‚Äù like the soundtrack in this
taaha69,13 Mar 2024,Lisan Al gaib

lunacrsco,11 Mar 2024,toujours √©couter javier bardem
owen,13 Mar 2024,Here before it sweeps the oscars
kpoki,13 Mar 2024,"So much better than the first one, cause the first one is just a setup. The music is great, the acting is amazing, the story is great, the visuals are stunning. This makes me excited for future dune movies. I didn't want it to end."
bella,09 Mar 2024,this was the most fun ive had in a cinema in actual years and it was just the absolute best
markg88,13 Mar 2024,Dune 2 is the definition of cinematic masterpiece with every scene adding to the climax of the movie. Every character introduce into this world with such care. You can tell the director took this franchise with care and importance. It is a must watch for years to come
F√°bio M,12 Mar 2024,"For certain, the soundtrack sticks back with scale.Definitely need to watch the movie again."
Diana,12 Mar 2024,I think the feeling I‚Äôll get when I see my first borns take their first steps will be the same feeling as me seeing Paul Atreides ride his first sand worm.

dazy030,10 Mar 2024,an absolute masterpiece
Carson Hilton,13 Mar 2024,"One of the single most creative movies I‚Äôve seen. The sense of scale, the set design, Hans Zimmer‚Äôs score, the shots, the acting, everything was so cohesive to give such a specific ‚Äúotherworldy‚Äù feel, somehow even more so than Part One. "
Julia Rachel,09 Mar 2024,Incredible. Amazing. Mind blowing. Heartbroken I have wait a whole century before the next one comes out.

lexi3103,13 Mar 2024,Just a masterpiece
inops98,10 Mar 2024,absolute cinema
Coreyoc,13 Mar 2024,One of the most impressive feats this film manages to achieve is to capture you within the environment. I was there. I don‚Äôt think I can say that for many films. I feel this comes down to the attention to detail and precision with which everything is carried out. You can really feel the passion and care that went into the film. It wasn‚Äôt a rushed process and everything from the VFX to sound to acting is done with love. Roll on number three!
alissmrn,13 Mar 2024,"great soundtrack. meh fight scenes. i love timothee but the acting when he‚Äôs trying to be intimidating just doesnt work for me, especially when he stomped his foot."

ashley,13 Mar 2024,"woah again!not only was this even better the second time around, i also got to watch it while sitting 3 rows behind david dobrik and my personal lisan al gaib, noah beck. who knew they were dune heads just like me? was also very fun to watch with jonny and getting to see his reactions to everything that was so majorbut anyways i guess i promised a real review this time‚Ä¶ but honestly i am just so in‚Ä¶"

Bear,13 Mar 2024,"It somehow improves upon on the magic and spectacle of the first one; it feels like the parts and lore of the first movie are moving in a natural and captivating succession.The battle of prophecy & coincidence is such a strong and gripping through line, Paul‚Äôs savvy in seeing through this & his political action afterwards makes sense even if the pacing can seem odd the writing was on the walls."

Kaknaque,13 Mar 2024,"Une ≈ìuvre cin√©matographique magistrale, y‚Äôa tout, une direction artistique visionnaire (costumes, d√©cors, lumi√®re 10/10), et des performances remarquables Austin Butler flippant en Majin Buu, Souheila Yacoub qui nous sort une performance en parlant une langue invent√©e, c‚Äôest trop fort. Le film est vraiment immersif et captivant en explorant des th√®mes comme le pouvoir et la religion avec subtilit√© et intelligence. Bref un chef-d'≈ìuvre incontournable de la science-fiction moderne."
EllioDubs,13 Mar 2024,"Cinematic spectacle. Visually it‚Äôs amazing, and the pacing of the film is easy to flow with. However, my only gripe is that something is missing. I feel many people will get swept away with how great this movie looks or makes you feel, but the actual content is missing certain links to bring the story together."

Newton M,09 Mar 2024,A behemoth of a film. This is going to linger in the back of my mind for the rest of my life. Denis Villeneuve is making sci-fi history and I am so here for it. This is possibly the most important sci-fi film franchise since Star Wars. Villeneuve has earned his place as one of the greatest directors of all time. Had to give this one a couple days to sit on till I wrote something about it.

nathaniel,13 Mar 2024,"absolutely blown away. coming into this film with almost no expectations, wondering how they could top the first one, to say i was surprised would be an understatement. Denis Villeneuve knocks it out of the park with this one. nothing could‚Äôve prepared me for what was almost 3 hours of a stellar film that literally had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. the goat Hans Zimmer again with an amazing soundtrack, crazy fight scenes, and a gripping plot that had me hooked the entire time, this will be a film that will go down in history as the new sci fi classic."
thefilmexplorer,10 Mar 2024,"One of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen. The sound and music were fantastic they really tied it all together. The world building was incredibly well done I felt like I was transported to each location every time the scenes changed. My favourite part however has to be the costuming, it was detailed, distinct and clearly well made and tailored to each character. Their clothes did such a great job to communicate changes in the movie such as time, comfort and influence."

Fidel Reyes,12 Mar 2024,"My partner wanted to rewatch it for the first time so I tagged along for my fourth round. Fuck, what a great film. Dolby Atmos may be my favorite screen format, GORGEOUS. As Nicole Kidman said, ""sound that I can feel."""

KC,13 Mar 2024,If you didn't like the first film that much definitely give this one a shot.
luisgacov,13 Mar 2024,"These type of science fiction films don't speak to me. Maybe I'm too old now. The characters are closer to be 2D cartoons than human beings. But that's only my smart ass opinion haha. The movie is enjoyable and visually is truly impressive. Well, 190 million dollars well spent."
colinorjames,13 Mar 2024,"I watched Dune 1 and 2 back to back today and I'll be honest I have no idea wtf was going on. If you asked me to tell you the plot I'd be like ""people talk in a whispered voice and there's sand""Not a fan but 2 was alot better than 1 if that helps because shit actually happens. I just wish people acted like people in these movies instead of saying all their lines super softly, give us‚Ä¶"

Episkey_1,04 Mar 2024,That's why boys mum should not get power.
Mot96,03 Mar 2024,"A typical Villeneuve Movie. And thats a big compliment. Villeneuve has retained everything that made the first part so special. The action scenes are rare, but when they happen, they are epic, technically implemented at the highest level and thrilling.What once again sets Villeneuve's film apart from other blockbusters is the visual story telling. I don't need everything explained. Villeneuve certainly trusts his viewers to draw the necessary conclusions from what they see.The acting is outstanding, let's exclude‚Ä¶"

TBWC_Nick,12 Mar 2024,"Oh, Dune Part Two. Hardly any other film makes it so difficult for me to love it. Especially when you sit in the cinema and see this audiovisual masterpiece on the biggest screen possible, you just want to love it. But then there are these small but subtle problems that make it difficult for me to call this film adaptation a masterpiece. The OV does solve some problems that I still had with the German synchro. But the point remains‚Ä¶"

Anthony_Esteban,13 Mar 2024,"The craze about his movie just doesn't compute with me. It's dumb, long, and boring. I love Villeneuve's body of work, but his Dune doesn't move the needle for me. Of course it doesn't help that the source material is incredibly overrated to begin with."
francis_faye,13 Mar 2024,I have not had an experience watching a movie in the theatre's like this in a veryyyyy long time. That was absolutely incredible.

Nic Hall,13 Mar 2024,I know there is another film scheduled but i really hope Denis does what Nolan did when he alternated Batman movies with non-batman movies
AlexElSancho,13 Mar 2024,Excellent mais Nolan aurait trouv√© des vrais Shai uluds et aurait fait peter une vraie nuke sur le gros lard pour un peu + de r√©alisme (c‚Äôest pas un concours Villeneuve masterclass tabarnak)
daggerwitch,12 Mar 2024,"A 3 hour lore-filled movie that builds off of the first movie. Stunning visuals, amazing worldbuilding, and a cast that makes you point and say 'I know that guy/girl!'"

Victor Sauce,13 Mar 2024,"I don't know, maybe movies just get boring and feel like a waste of time once you start having an actually interesting life with adventures, wood chipping etc.. Forgot that it is sometimes worth going to theatres though, this is good but I just got angry because I just wanted to go tramping the whole time. once again, not sure why because this is about a big desert which is a boring place for a tramp but just trapped atm with a fractured shoulder and little timmy gets to run down sand dunes ooh la la la I'm the prophet. Whatever"

I didn't remember a thing from the first movie but this movie was so well made and immersive that you could enjoy it without much context from the first. Truly an amazing movie going experience cannot stress it enough"

Aleksandre_L,13 Mar 2024,"It hardly seems worthwhile to discuss the visual aspects; every artificial intelligence manages better, and indeed, we had already seen painters and cinematographers creating better ocular works even before AI. If you still find your jaw dropping throughout, you're likely either very new to art and cinema or miraculously maintained an unblemished gaze‚Äîfor which I envy you. Nonetheless, there's nothing particularly new or captivating here. Speaking of visuals, have you seen Mad Max? Though not a masterpiece, it outshines this‚Ä¶"
