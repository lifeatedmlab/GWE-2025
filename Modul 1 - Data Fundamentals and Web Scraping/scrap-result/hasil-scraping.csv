tyler, leaving arrakis and coming back into our shitty reality after the movie ended was absolutely devastating 
George Carmi,"  Nothing short of a monumental achievement in science-fiction filmmaking. Sensory overload and one of the most immersive cinematic experiences ever crafted. Denis Villeneuve is operating on another level. A level of ambition and audacity we rarely see within the art form. Dune: Part Two elevates itself to transcendent heights, among the pantheon of greats. It has cemented its name alongside the immortals in film history as one of the greatest sequels ever made.I've had time to really let this…  "
the film drunk, Watching this in IMAX while fisting the dune popcorn bucket is the correct way to watchThat is what the movies were made for 
Sydney🚀, Are you fucking kidding me 
CinemaJoe," This is big time, feels like we are witnessing history.Found myself consistently stunned, not so much by the enormity of the physical, but by its ability to amplify the intimate. There’s a moment in the movie, where a switch is flipped and Paul begins to embrace the fanaticism and that’s when I knew I was watching something special. Also the sandworm scene.When does loyalty shift into worship? Like a line drawn in sand, it exists as we stare at it, but once we look away, it becomes indistinguishable.Podcast Ep. 162- Dune Part 2 "
Zoë Rose Bryant, This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  i would be so easily manipulated by someone claiming to be a messiah because the scene where paul learns how to ride a sandworm made me believe in god again  
24framesofnick,"  That’s it. That’s the best sci fi ever madeThere is simply nothing that could ever be as spectacular, as grand, as well thought out, as beautiful, as fucking AMAZINGThis is a movie that exists only once in a generation. A story that grabs you and pulls you in. Enticing you to follow the journey until you’re ripped to shreds from exhaustionThere is a scale here that could only be accomplished today in this time of our species.…  "
corey👻, literally shaking and crying. the man has dune it again 
Hannah, I hope Austin Butler gets trapped doing his Fayd-Rautha voice like he did with Elvis 
molly, This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  why did austin butler go in for seconds when kissing his uncle…AW HELL NAH 😨😨😭😭😭😭  
Gav Murphy, Loved seeing the freaky little box again. Extra Star cause I think that bald fella stuck his dick in it.

noen," When I die, please play a hans zimmer soundtrack so that I can finally rest in peace, thank you "
Kit Lazer," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  The only bad thing about this movie is looking ahead to Paul Atreides having more toxic fans than Eren Yeager.People are going to say it was overhyped. Do you want me to fucking lie to you and say I didn’t burst into tears from the sheer audacity of it? Well, I won’t do it. Don’t fear the hype. Fear is the mind killer.  "
justinwuah, the end credits were rolling and i was just seated there with my dune popcorn bucket wondering what are we 
Cam Walsh, This is truly the cinematic event of our generation… don’t take it for granted100/100 
davidehrlich,"  Denis Villeneuve has insisted that “Dune: Part Two” would be a direct continuation of its predecessor rather than a sequel, and the man has absolutely made good on that promise: Not only does this new movie pick up exactly where the last one left off, it also carries over the strengths and weaknesses that made the previous chapter so astonishing to look at but stultifying to watch. Once again, Frank Herbert’s sand-blasted spice opera has been adapted at a scale…  "
maria," austin butler is so bald. i've never seen anyone be so bald in my life. so moisturised and bald. he was glowing more than edward in twilight. what's your megamind head skin care routine, elvis boy "
Lucy, me from this day forward any time i go to grab the blue gatorade from a 7-eleven freezer: THE WATER OF LIFE 
George Carmi, Monumental. Colossal. Herculean. Transcendent.An experience. An event. A moment. Our Empire Strikes Back. but better (?). 
CinemaJoe, SILENCE. 
Thomas Flight,"  An absolutely gorgeous, austere piece of film. Denis is serving up some of the most majestic of scientific fiction images we've seen on the 21st century cinema screen. In many ways overcomes some of the weakness of the first (pacing overall felt better, obviously less setup, the score is used more sparingly in a way that allows many more moments breathe). But still suffers from the necessity of cramming so much story into such a small space. Some beats that…  "
Matt!,"  Christopher Nolan owes Denis Villeneuve some serious head action for graciously delaying this movie till after Oppenheimer’s Oscar campaign had already locked up all the awards. Or, if not the sloppiest of toppies, then at the very least a nice Edible Arrangement or something, because this shit was off the absolute chizzle. Bewildering spectacle, unreal sound design, deeply thought-provoking messianic complexities, and enough giant sandworm battles to make Burt Gummer cream his cargo pants. Easily one of the most impressive…  "
alexcolemann,"  This is why we fucking make movies. I’m grateful I was able to stay alive long enough to witness this masterpiece. Masterpiece somehow being an understatement, this is a project that shouldn’t be possible but Denis and the crew — with their God given talents — made dreams come true. It’s a truly grand experience and maybe the greatest thing I’ve ever seen. The performances (Timmy, Rebecca, Zendaya, Austin and Javier Bardem specifically) are all worthy of Oscar praise and…  "

Zoë Rose Bryant, a cautionary tale for mothers who tell their sons they’re special 
Jay, I don’t think it was such a good idea to give the messiah the nuclear launch codes 
ValTheMovieGuy, Find someone who loves you as much as Stilgar loves Paul 
Sethsreviews,"  A direct sequel that matches the impact of a monumental first film is rare, yet Denis Villeneuve succeeded in topping it. An overwhelming sensory masterpiece. Drenched in tragedy and intricately structured mystique. As with the first film, this never fails to deliver awe-inspiring visual sequences one after another, as well as a mounting sense of devastation and fear concerning the paths of several characters. I genuinely believe that this is an instant classic, and I don't say that without seriousness.…  "
ram<3," ”feyd rautha takes his skincare routine very seriously"" "
noen," Every tiny detail is breathtaking, the scenery, the sound, the angles, the movement, what Villeneuve does in this film is far beyond what anyone expects, we are witnessing the birth of an inevitable masterpiece in the future history of cinema. "
Tyler Whitmore," A tragedy. A prophecy. A masterpiece. Austin Butler absolutely deserves an Oscar nomination for his portrayal as Feyd Rautha and I’m being so serious. Tragic, horrifying, mesmerizing. Dune: Part Two delivers in every way imaginable and elevates Denis Villeneuve into the shortlist of greatest directors of all time.Please don’t make me wait 5 years for the next Dune.Denis Villeneuve Ranked 2024 Ranked  "
SilentDawn," 80If I'd attempt any sort of argument against this, it's that Denis Villeneuve's penchant for brutalist minimalism on a massive canvas does sometimes erupt the eardrums and stimulate the senses more than fully interrogating/expanding on the ideas in the book. But it's not a major complaint. This is soul-stirring spectacle served on a palatable, accessible platter. Easy to tumble into and get lost in. Not a weak link in the cast. Breathtaking vistas. Standard 70mm projection was lovely. "
